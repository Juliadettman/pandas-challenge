# pandas-challenge
This challenge allowed us to sort through a large amount of data between schools to draw on specific areas. Some of these areas included school type, number of students, student scores, math scores, reading scores, and scores by average. The point of this analysis was to break down the data into smaller pieces and extract specific data sets to draw conclusions.
After completing this challenge, many conclusions became clear. The first thing I noticed from thr data set was that for each school ranked for passing math scores, they were equally ranked in passing reading scores. Another conclusion that stood out to me was how school type affected performance. The charter schools had higher average math and reading scores compared to the district schools as well as the percentage of students passing math and reading. This distinction shows that kids are exceling more in the charter schools than the district schools.
